film Anyone who reads film Old and Middle English literary texts will
be familiar with the mid-brown volumes of the EETS, with the
symbol of Alfred's jewel embossed on the front cover. Most of
the works attributed to King Alfred or film to Aelfric, along with
some of those by bishop Wulfstan and much anonymous prose and
verse from the pre-Conquest period, are to be found within the film
Society's three series; all of the surviving medieval drama, most
of the Middle film English romances, much religious and secular prose
and verse including the English works of John Gower, Thomas Hoccleve
and most of Caxton's prints all find their place film in the publications.
Without EETS editions, study of medieval English texts would hardly be possible.
